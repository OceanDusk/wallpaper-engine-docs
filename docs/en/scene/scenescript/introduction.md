Wallpaper Engine features a custom scripting language called *SceneScript*. It's based on the JavaScript 2018 core functionality and adds a couple of additional functions and classes specific to Wallpaper Engine on top.

We are still working on converting all SceneScript references and guidelines for this new website, until then you can find all guides on our old Wiki:
