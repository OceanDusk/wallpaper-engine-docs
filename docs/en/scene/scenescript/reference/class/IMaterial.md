# SceneScript Class IMaterial

This class holds no static properties you should use, but you can access dynamic properties from materials. To do this, bind a script to any shader property, like **Alpha** or **Color** and use the dynamic auto-completion in the SceneScript editor from `thisObject` to discover them.
