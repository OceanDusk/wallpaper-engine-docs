## A foreword on wallpaper resolutions

Before jumping into animating your wallpaper, first a quick word on preparing any background images you want to animate:

It's best practice to prepare your background image with a photo editor of your choice to **ensure that the wallpaper uses a resolution that exists on computer monitors**. Strictly speaking, this is not necessary and Wallpaper Engine will accept any image resolution, however, you will achieve the best performance if the wallpaper matches the resolution of your screen or at least the correct aspect ratio. 

The most common resolutions are **1920x1080** ("Full HD") and **3840x2160** ("4K UHD"). If your wallpaper does not use a resolution from the supported resolution list, it will be marked as **Other Resolution** which may negatively affect its popularity.

To exemplify why it's bad to use wallpapers that do not have a real aspect ratio: Let's say you have an image that is 2000x2000 pixels. No computer monitor on the market has this resolution, so when you import and animate an image with this resolution, Wallpaper Engine will cut off the sides of your wallpaper once you apply it to your desktop to make it fit to your screen. The following image showcases how much is cut off if you use a 2000x2000 image on a 1920x1080 monitor:

![Square image compares to 16:9 aspect ratio](./aspectratio.jpg)
*Red areas would be cut off if this square images was displayed on a 16:9 monitor.*

The downsides of this are an increased GPU usage, less control over what is actually visible on the screen and larger file sizes and VRAM usage.

We generally recommend you scale down images to the nearest closer real resolution and then manually crop off excess areas. You can use free image editing tools like Microsoft Paint, Paint.NET, GIMP or paid alternatives such as Adobe Photoshop to do this. Again, it's not necessary but we recommend preparing background images before importing them.
