# RGB Hardware Support

Wallpaper Engine allows you to take control of supported RGB devices through its API and synchronize your wallpaper with LED hardware. Even if you do not own any or just a limited set of compatible hardware, you can simply utilize an emulator. Both Corsair's iCUE software and Razer offer ways to emulate devices that you do not own.

## Hardware Emulator Setup (Optional)

If you want to utilize an RGB hardware emulator to test how your RGB lights look on a wide range of devices, we recommend the Razer Chroma emulator.

First, make sure you have the latest version of Razer Synapse 3 installed. It's also important to make sure you install **Chroma Connect** in the Razer Synapse settings:

* [Download Razer Synapse 3](https://www.razer.com/synapse-3)

Afterwards, head to the Razer developer portal and install the latest version of the Razer Chroma emulator (scroll down on the page to get the link):

* [Razer Developer Portal](https://developer.razer.com/works-with-chroma/download/)

Once you have installed Razer Synapse 3 and the latest Razer Emulator, restart Wallpaper Engine and make sure the LED Plugin is enabled in the application settings. Verify that the emulator works by using any of the standard wallpapers that are shipped alongside Wallpaper Engine (such as **Razer Bedroom**).
