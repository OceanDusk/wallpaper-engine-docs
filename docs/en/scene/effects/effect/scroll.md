# Scroll Effect

The **Scroll** effect can be used to continuously scroll an image in a specified direction. It's useful for textures that loop seamlessly and can be used to create special effects in combination with other effects.

## Effect settings

The effect has two basic types of settings: A *Repeat* option for each axis and a *Speed* option for each axis. The repeat option can be used to scale the image and determines how often your texture is "repeated" on its given space. The *Speed* option determines how fast the image scrolls into a direction. For example, setting *Speed X* to **1** and *Speed Y* to **0** will cause the image scroll from right to left.

* **Repeat X:** How often the image is repeated horizontally within its area.
* **Repeat Y:** How often the image is repeated vertically within its area.

* **Speed X:** Speed in horizontal direction.
* **Speed Y:** Speed in vertical direction.
