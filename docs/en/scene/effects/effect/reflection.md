# Reflection Effect

The **Reflection** effect allows you to reflect a part of the image on a given axis. This allows you to even reflect underlying animations. Make sure to start with painting the opacity mask in order to see the effect.

### Effect Settings

* **Blend mode:** How the reflection is blended with the image.
* **Opacity mask:** This mask controls where the reflection is visible. You have to paint this first in order to see any reflection at all.
* **Alpha:** How strongly the reflection is visible.
* **Direction:** This allows you to change the axis of the reflection. By default the image is reflected horizontally.
* **Offset:** This allows you to shift the center of the reflection, along the direction you have set.
