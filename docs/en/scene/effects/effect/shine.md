# Shine Effect

The **Shine** effect is similar to the [Godrays effect](/scene/effects/effect/godrays.html) but instead of just adding a ray, it also adds a glow effect to the bright parts of your iamge layer. This can be used to create certain light scenarios but also works well in combination with particle systems. The effect can be extensively customized and you might need to tweak a little depending on your use-case.
