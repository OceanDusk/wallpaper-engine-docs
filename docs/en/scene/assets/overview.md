# Assets Overview

Assets in Wallpaper Engine are individual elements or components of your wallpaper. Much like in traditional image editing software, assets are arranged as layers, so you can rearrange them in a certain order in the asset list to define which elements are at the front or the back of each other.

You can add assets to your wallpaper by clicking on the **Add Asset** button on the left-hand side of the screen. This will open an overview of all assets installed by default and will also offer some special asset types towards the bottom of the list. You can select an asset and confirm your selection by pressing **OK**, which will add the asset to your wallpaper. Alternatively, if you would like to include any external files such as additional images or sound effects, you can simply drag and drop them into the asset area and they will be imported automatically if the file type is supported:

## Using handles to move, rotate and scale assets

Your assets will be added to your wallpaper immediately but the position and size may not immediately be the way you want them. Wallpaper Engine uses 3D handles which you may already be familiar with if you have ever worked with a 3D game engine. These handles allow you to easily modify the **Origin** (*the position*), the **Angle** (*the rotation*) and the **Scale** (*the size*) of your assets. Watch the video below to see how the different handles allow you to move, scale and resize your assets:
