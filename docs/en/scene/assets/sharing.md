# Asset Creation & Sharing

If you want to create an asset for others to re-use in their wallpapers, you first have to enable the asset creation options in the editor. These are hidden by default to avoid that they confuse new users when trying to publish a wallpaper.

## Enable Asset Creation

You can enable asset creation and sharing in the **View** menu by clicking **Enable Asset Creation**.

## Sharing Effect or Layer Assets

There will now be a new share option right above the wallpaper share option in the Workshop menu. Use **Share Assets on Workshop** to upload your assets.

You can choose between **layers** and **effects** from this menu. If you decide to share layers, you can select multiple layers from your current project that will be uploaded - including any dependencies they have to other assets, like textures, shaders, child particles etc. Just make sure you select all layers that you want to share.

If you decide to share an effect, you can choose a single of your custom effects. Unless you already created a new effect, this menu will be empty.

If you're sharing multiple layers, you can share them as an asset pack. This option will allow the user to only import one of those layers into their wallpaper and not all at once. This is useful if you want to create a bunch of similar particle effects, for example, but the user is expected to only import one or a few of them and not all together.

## Sharing Scripts

Besides layers and effects, you can also share individual scripts after enabling asset creation. To share a script, open the script editor for the script that you have created already and go to the **Workshop** menu. From there, select **Share Script on Workshop**. From here you will find the familiar Workshop sharing menu to share your script.

## Create New Effect

Enabling asset sharing will also enable a new option in the effect menu in the bottom left. You can click on **New** to create a new shader effect and you will get started off with a basic passthrough shader that doesn't do anything special.

Alternatively, you can also click on any existing effect and then use the **Duplicate** button. That allows you to create a copy of an existing effect and make changes to this - saving you a ton of work. If you want to make changes to an existing effect, this makes it a lot easier to create a variation of one.
