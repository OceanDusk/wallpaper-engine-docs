# Timeline Animations on Effects

You can also utilize timeline animations on properties of effects. In this guide we will show you how you can use the [Refraction effect](/scene/effects/effect/refraction) in combination with a timeline animation to create a growing amount of ice on a surface. Obviously this is a very specific example, you can apply timeline animations in wildly different scenarios, it's really up to your imagination what to do with them.

We will also make use of the animation modes **Mirror** and **Single** as part of this tutorial to showcase what uses they have in this type of scenario.
