# Character Sheets

An advanced way to approach puppet warping is to rely on character sheets. Character sheets require you to use a cut-up version of your character which separates your character into its different limbs / pieces. This allows for more complex and more accurate animations to be created.

## Creating a character sheet

Make sure to separate each individual body and clothing part into their own separate element and place them on a square image. Try to keep the image as small as possible and make sure it's an actual square image file as this saves performance and video memory.

In our example, we use the samurai character from our previous puppet warping tutorials and cut it up into its own character sheet using a photo editing tool. Our character sheet looks as follows:
