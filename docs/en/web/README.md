# Web Wallpaper Reference Guide

This section of the Wallpaper Engine designer documentation will guide you through the creation of wallpapers based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This website will not explain how to use these technologies and only addresses topics which are specific to Wallpaper Engine itself.

::: tip
If you want to create a wallpaper using the Wallpaper Engine editor, you should instead look at the [documentation for Scene wallpapers](/en/scene).
