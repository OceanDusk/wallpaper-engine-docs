# Nitro Effect

The **Nitro** effect allows you to add lightning flashes to an image. Two scrolling textures are blended on top of one another and then filtered to achieve this effect.

### Effect Settings

* **Blend mode:** How the nitro effect is blended with the background. In HDR mode the option *add* can be used to get the best HDR glow effects.
* **Write alpha:** Enabling this option will make the background image transparent where there is no nitro effect overlayed.
* **Albedo:** The texture used to generate the nitro effect.
* **Opacity mask:** The opacity mask can be used to limit the effect to certain parts of the image.
* **Bounds:** This controls the width of the nitro effect. Increase the interval between these values to make the lines of the effect wider.
* **Color start:** The first color that is used for the nitro lines. This color is dominant where the effect is strongly visible.
* **Color end:** The second color that is used for the nitro lines. This color is dominant where the effect is just barely visible.
* **Multiply:** How strong the effect is visible.
* **Scale:** The size of the effect along the X and Y axes.
* **Smoothness:** You can use this to smoothen the lines of the effect.
* **Speed:** The scrolling speed of the texture used to generate the effect. X and Y are used for the first sample and Z and W are used for the second sample.
