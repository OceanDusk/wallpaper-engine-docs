# Opacity Effect

The **Opacity** effect allows you to make parts of the image transparent. In general this effect should only be used in combination with any animations. If you can simply edit your image and make it transparent beforehand, then you should definitely opt for that, because that would be better for performance than using an unnecessary effect.

### Effect Settings

* **Opacity mask:** This is the opacity mask that will be applied to the image.
* **Alpha:** This allows you to easily scale the opacity of the entire mask at once.
