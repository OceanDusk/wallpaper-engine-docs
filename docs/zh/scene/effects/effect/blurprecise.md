# Blur Precise Effect

The **Blur Precise** effect applies a precise gaussian blur to the image. Try and see if the [normal Blur effect](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/effects/effect/blur) might suffice for your use-case, as it performs better than Blur Precise. Blur Precise is especially useful to achieve better results with god rays, outlines and similar effects.

If you just want to add a static blur to your image, you should rather do this in an image editor before importing your image into Wallpaper Engine.

### Effect Settings

This effect always affects the complete layer. You can configure its kernel size and scale for each axis:

* **Kernel size:** The size of the filter kernel. A larger kernel makes the image more blurry but also requires more system performance.
* **Scale:** Controls the amount of blur on the X and Y axis.
