# Tint Effect

The **Tint** effect allows you to colorize the image. In general this effect should only be used in combination with any animations. If you can simply edit your image and colorize it beforehand, then you should definitely opt for that, because that would be better for performance than using an unnecessary effect.

### Effect Settings

* **Blend mode:** Controls how the color blends with the image.
* **Opacity mask:** This allows you to limit the effect to certain parts of the image.
* **Alpha:** This allows you to control the strength of the effect over the entire image.
* **Color:** The color that you are adding to the image.
