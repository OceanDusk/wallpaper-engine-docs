# Local Contrast Effect

The **Local Contrast** effect can be used for high quality contrast enhancement. Instead of just boosting the contrast of the entire image, this effect uses a method to specifically increase the contrast in areas where it matters.

### Effect Settings

* **Opacity mask:** You can paint this mask to limit the effect only to specific parts of the image.
* **Kernel size:** This controls the quality and size of the contrast enhancement.
* **Grayscale:** Enabling this will make the contrast enhancement black and white only.
* **Scale:** The size of the kernel used to find areas for contrast enhancement.
* **Strength:** How strong the contrast enhancement will be.
